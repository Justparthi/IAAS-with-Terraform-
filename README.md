To use Terraform for creating and managing infrastructure as code (IaC), you need to write Terraform configuration files to define your cloud resources (e.g., AWS EC2 instances). Below are the steps and GitHub documentation links that will guide you in using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and management.

### Steps for Using Terraform to Provision AWS Infrastructure

#### 1. **Install Terraform**

First, install Terraform on your machine. Here's how you can install it on various operating systems:

- **For macOS (using Homebrew):**

    ```bash
    brew install terraform
    ```

- **For Windows (using Chocolatey):**

    ```bash
    choco install terraform
    ```

- **For Linux (using APT):**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install terraform
    ```

Check if Terraform is installed properly by running:

```bash
terraform -v
```

#### 2. **Configure AWS Provider**

To provision AWS resources with Terraform, you need to configure the AWS provider. Create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) with the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

This configuration specifies the AWS provider and the AWS region (`us-east-1` in this case).

#### 3. **Create EC2 Instance Configuration**

In the same directory where you created `main.tf`, define an EC2 instance configuration. For example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Replace with a valid AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "MyEC2Instance"
  }
}
```

This configuration creates an EC2 instance using a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type (`t2.micro`). Replace the `ami` value with the correct AMI ID for your region.

#### 4. **Initialize Terraform**

Before applying the configuration, initialize Terraform in the directory containing your `.tf` files. This step downloads the necessary provider plugins (such as the AWS provider).

```bash
terraform init
```

#### 5. **Apply Terraform Configuration**

To provision the resources defined in the configuration, run the `terraform apply` command. This command will show you a plan of what will be created.

```bash
terraform apply
```

Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

#### 6. **Destroy Infrastructure**

If you want to destroy the resources you’ve provisioned, run the `terraform destroy` command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This will prompt you to confirm the destruction of the resources. Type `yes` to proceed.

#### 7. **View the Output**

After running `terraform apply`, you can view the output of your resources (e.g., the instance ID, public IP) using the `terraform output` command.

#### 8. **Additional Configuration (Optional)**

You can add more resources to your Terraform configuration, such as Security Groups, VPCs, Load Balancers, etc., by following Terraform's resource documentation.

### Example Directory Structure:

```
/my-terraform-project
  ├── main.tf
  └── terraform.tfvars (optional)
```

- `main.tf` contains the primary configuration files (e.g., AWS resources).
- `terraform.tfvars` (optional) can store sensitive or environment-specific variables.
